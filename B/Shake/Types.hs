-- | The current assumptions made by the build system, used by 'shakeAssume'. These options

--   dirty, regardless of what the build system thinks.

--   other files in the database are left unchanged.

        --   for rebuilding if untracked dependencies have changed. This assumption is safe, but may cause
        --   more rebuilding than necessary.
    | AssumeClean
        -- ^ /This assumption is unsafe, and may lead to incorrect build results in this run, and in future runs/.
        --   Assume and record that all rules reached are clean and do not require rebuilding, provided the rule
        --   has a 'Development.Shake.storedValue' and has been built before. Useful if you have modified a file in some
        --   inconsequential way, such as only the comments or whitespace, and wish to avoid a rebuild.

data ShakeOptions = ShakeOptions
    {shakeFiles :: FilePath
        -- ^ Defaults to @.shake@. The prefix of the filename used for storing Shake metadata files.
        --   All metadata files will be named @'shakeFiles'./extension/@, for some @/extension/@.
    ,shakeThreads :: Int
        -- ^ Defaults to @1@. Maximum number of rules to run in parallel, similar to @make --jobs=/N/@.
        --   To enable parallelism you may need to compile with @-threaded@.
        --   For many build systems, a number equal to or slightly less than the number of physical processors
        --   works well.
    ,shakeVersion :: String
        -- ^ Defaults to @"1"@. The version number of your build rules.
        --   Change the version number to force a complete rebuild, such as when making
        --   significant changes to the rules that require a wipe. The version number should be
        --   set in the source code, and not passed on the command line.
    ,shakeVerbosity :: Verbosity
        -- ^ Defaults to 'Normal'. What level of messages should be printed out.
    ,shakeStaunch :: Bool
        -- ^ Defaults to 'False'. Operate in staunch mode, where building continues even after errors,
        --   similar to @make --keep-going@.
    ,shakeReport :: Maybe FilePath
        -- ^ Defaults to 'Nothing'. Write an HTML profiling report to a file, showing which
        --   rules rebuilt, why, and how much time they took. Useful for improving the speed of your build systems.
    ,shakeLint :: Bool
        -- ^ Defaults to 'False'. Perform basic sanity checks during building, checking the current directory
        --   is not modified and that output files are not modified by multiple rules.
        --   These sanity checks do not check for missing or redundant dependencies.
    ,shakeFlush :: Maybe Double
        -- ^ Defaults to @'Just' 10@. How often to flush Shake metadata files in seconds, or 'Nothing' to never flush explicitly.
        --   It is possible that on abnormal termination (not Haskell exceptions) any rules that completed in the last
        --   'shakeFlush' seconds will be lost.
    ,shakeAssume :: Maybe Assume
        -- ^ Defaults to 'Nothing'. Assume all build objects are clean/dirty, see 'Assume' for details.
        --   Can be used to implement @make --touch@.
    ,shakeAbbreviations :: [(String,String)]
        -- ^ Defaults to @[]@. A list of substrings that should be abbreviated in status messages, and their corresponding abbreviation.
        --   Commonly used to replace the long paths (e.g. @.make\/i586-linux-gcc\/output@) with an abbreviation (e.g. @$OUT@).
    ,shakeStorageLog :: Bool
        -- ^ Defaults to 'False'. Write a message to @'shakeFiles'.storage@ whenever a storage event happens which may impact
        --   on the current stored progress. Examples include database version number changes, database compaction or corrupt files.
    ,shakeLineBuffering :: Bool
        -- ^ Defaults to 'True'. Change 'stdout' and 'stderr' to line buffering while running Shake.
    ,shakeTimings :: Bool
        -- ^ Default to 'False'. Print timing information for each stage at the end.
    ,shakeProgress :: IO Progress -> IO ()
        -- ^ Defaults to no action. A function called on a separate thread when the build starts, allowing progress to be reported.
        --   For applications that want to display progress messages, 'progressSimple' is often sufficient, but more advanced
        --   users should look at the 'Progress' data type.
    ,shakeOutput :: Verbosity -> String -> IO ()
        -- ^ Defaults to writing using 'putStrLn'. A function called to output messages from Shake, along with the 'Verbosity' at
        --   which that message should be printed. This function will be called atomically from all other 'shakeOutput' functions.
        --   The 'Verbosity' will always be greater than or higher than 'shakeVerbosity'.
